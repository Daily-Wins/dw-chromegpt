This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

AI Form Filler MVP - A Chrome extension that automatically fills web forms using OpenAI Assistant API with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities. The extension detects forms on any webpage, extracts form structure, queries an OpenAI Assistant with access to company documents, and automatically fills form fields with relevant data.

## Architecture

### Core Components

```
Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)
â”œâ”€â”€ popup.html/popup.js         â†’ Settings UI (API key, Assistant ID)
â”œâ”€â”€ content.js                  â†’ Form detection & filling
â”œâ”€â”€ background.js               â†’ OpenAI Assistant API integration
â””â”€â”€ styles.css                  â†’ UI styling

Setup Scripts
â””â”€â”€ setup-assistant.js          â†’ Creates OpenAI Assistant with RAG
```

### Data Flow

1. **Form Detection**: content.js detects forms on webpage using MutationObserver
   - Runs in all frames (top + iframes) via `all_frames: true`
   - Polls at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 seconds to catch dynamically loaded forms
   - Detects HubSpot forms by watching for `.hbspt-form`, `.hs-form` classes
2. **Form Analysis**: Extracts form structure (fields, labels, types)
3. **AI Processing**: background.js sends form data to OpenAI Assistant API
4. **RAG Search**: Assistant searches uploaded company documents
5. **Response**: Assistant returns JSON with field values
6. **Form Filling**: content.js populates form fields with AI-generated data

### OpenAI Assistant Integration

The extension uses OpenAI's Assistant API v2 with:
- **file_search tool**: Enables RAG over uploaded documents
- **vector_store**: Stores company documents (PDF, XLSX, DOCX)
- **Threads**: Stateful conversations for each form fill request
- **Streaming responses**: Polls for completion status

## Development Commands

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Set OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# Create OpenAI Assistant and upload documents
npm run setup
# Save the Assistant ID output!
```

### Chrome Extension Development

1. Open Chrome â†’ `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked" â†’ select project directory
4. Click extension icon â†’ configure API key and Assistant ID
5. Visit any webpage with forms â†’ click "ðŸ¤– Fyll med AI"

### Testing

Test on forms at:
- https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp
- Any real-world forms (LinkedIn, job applications, etc.)

## Key Files

### manifest.json
Chrome Extension Manifest V3 configuration. Uses:
- `storage` permission for API credentials
- `activeTab` permission for form access
- Service worker for background processing

### content.js
- Detects all `<form>` elements on page
- Adds "ðŸ¤– Fyll med AI" button to each form
- Extracts form structure (name, type, label, placeholder, required, options)
- Handles various label detection strategies (for-attribute, parent, sibling)
- Populates fields and dispatches events for SPA compatibility
- Provides visual feedback (loading states, success/error animations)

### background.js
OpenAI Assistant API integration:
- `createThread()` - Creates conversation thread
- `addMessage()` - Sends form structure to assistant
- `runAssistant()` - Executes assistant with file_search
- `waitForCompletion()` - Polls for completion (max 30 attempts)
- `getMessages()` - Retrieves assistant response
- Extracts JSON from markdown code blocks

### setup-assistant.js
One-time setup script that:
1. Uploads company documents (PDF, XLSX, DOCX) to OpenAI
2. Creates vector store for RAG
3. Creates Assistant with file_search capability
4. Outputs Assistant ID for extension configuration

## Chrome Extension Patterns

### Message Passing
- Content script â†’ Background worker: `chrome.runtime.sendMessage()`
- Async responses: `return true` to keep message channel open
- Promise-based communication for clean async/await usage

### Storage API
- `chrome.storage.local.get()` - Retrieve API credentials
- `chrome.storage.local.set()` - Save user configuration
- No sensitive data in extension files (only in storage)

### Content Script Injection
- Runs on all URLs (`<all_urls>`)
- Uses MutationObserver for SPA compatibility
- Dynamically adds UI elements without conflicting with page styles

## OpenAI Assistant Best Practices

### Instructions Format
Assistant returns data as JSON in markdown code blocks:
```json
{
  "fieldName": "value",
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

### Field Matching
- Uses exact field names as JSON keys
- Sends field metadata (label, type, required status) for context
- Returns `null` for missing information

### Cost Optimization
- Thread reuse possible for future optimization
- File search: ~$0.20/GB/day
- Per-request cost: ~$0.01-0.05
- Estimated monthly cost for 100 forms: $1-5

## Future Enhancements

When extending this MVP:
1. **SharePoint sync**: Automated document upload from SharePoint
2. **n8n integration**: Webhook triggers for workflow automation
3. **Chat widget**: Interactive UI for form filling
4. **Template library**: Pre-configured templates for common forms
5. **Thread reuse**: Cache threads per domain for faster responses
6. **Error handling**: Retry logic, fallback strategies
7. **Analytics**: Track form fill success rates

## Security Considerations

- API keys stored in chrome.storage (user-specific)
- No API keys in source code or git
- Service worker runs in isolated context
- Content script has limited permissions
- All API calls over HTTPS

## Troubleshooting

### Forms Not Detected

If the extension button appears but doesn't fill forms:

1. **Check console logs**:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Look for `ðŸš€ AI Form Filler` messages
   - Check for form detection logs showing field counts

2. **HubSpot forms specifically**:
   - Forms loaded via `hbspt.forms.create()` may take 5-10 seconds to appear
   - Extension polls every 2s up to 10s to detect them
   - Look for `ðŸ”” HubSpot form container upptÃ¤ckt!` in console

3. **Cross-origin iframes**:
   - Forms in iframes from different domains may be blocked by CORS
   - Check for "Blocked a frame with origin..." errors in console
   - Extension runs in all frames but CORS may prevent access

4. **Dynamic forms**:
   - MutationObserver watches for new forms added after page load
   - Some forms may load after user interaction (scroll, click)
   - Try scrolling to the form area before clicking the button

### Common Issues

- **Button not visible**: Check if forms exist on page with `document.querySelectorAll('form')`
- **"Timeout" error**: Assistant taking too long (>30s) - check OpenAI status
- **"Configure API key"**: Settings not saved - reopen popup and save again
- **0 fields filled**: Assistant returning wrong field names - check console logs for mismatch
